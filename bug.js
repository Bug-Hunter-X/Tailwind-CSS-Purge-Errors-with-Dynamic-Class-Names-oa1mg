This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The problem arises when the `purge` option in your `tailwind.config.js` isn't configured correctly, causing Tailwind to remove unused CSS classes that are actually being used in your application. This often happens when using dynamic class names or classes generated at runtime. For example, using a loop to add classes to elements, or using a state variable to update classes.  The result is that some elements won't be styled as expected, appearing as plain HTML elements.
